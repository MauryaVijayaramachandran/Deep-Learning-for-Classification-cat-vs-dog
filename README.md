# Deep-Learning-for-Classification-cat-vs-dog

This project aims to classify images of cats and dogs using a convolutional neural network (CNN).

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Cat and Dog Dataset from Microsoft. The dataset contains 25,000 images of cats and dogs, split into 12,500 training images and 12,500 test images.

# Dependencies
1.Python 3.6+
2.TensorFlow 2.0+
3.Keras 2.0+
4.NumPy
5.Matplotlib
# Results
After training the CNN on the Cat and Dog Dataset for 100 epochs, we achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test set. We also tested the model on some new images and achieved an accuracy of 80%.
